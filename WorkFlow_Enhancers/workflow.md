# Here is my workflow enhancers!

## [Microsoft PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/powertoys/)

Specifically for Windows 10, this is a great solution to toggle a Hexadecimal display using hotkeys, view SVGs & Markdown files right in File Explorer, you can make a custom layout for your Window snapping tool (I have 2 portrait screens, so vertical screen snaps down work for me, I made my own vertical snaps) You can get that nifty search bar that is just like MacOS, update Hotkeys, change image resizes, etc, etc, and I am sure I am missing a ton more.

A great prototyping tool! It is free and has a lot of PhotoShop like tooling, I love to do this to get and idea of what I will eventually code out.

## [Draw.io](http://draw.io/)

#### \*Backend Devs

Having a hard time thinking of the flow for how users will sign in, or create an account, or what pages your app needs to include. This is great for conceptualizing and visualizing the functionality in your apps.

#### \*Project Management

Who does what? How do we get there? What has been done and is left to do? This app will keep you and your team on the straight and narrow.
